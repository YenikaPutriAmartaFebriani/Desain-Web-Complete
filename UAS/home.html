                <p>YG Entertainment signaled the septet's formal introduction on December 30, 2022, with a poster and the subtext "YG Next Movement". It heralded a trailer-esque video posted on YouTube on New Year's Day that garnered 15 million views in three days, and featured appearances by members of Winner and Blackpink, sibling duo AKMU, dancer and choreographer Leejung Lee, and label founder Yang Hyun-suk. BabyMonster's introduction, together with the announcement of G-Dragon's feasible return as a soloist that same day, contributed to a subsequent rise in the label's stocks, leaping by 11.74%. The seven members were revealed to the public through gradual releases of live performance videos starting on January 12 (in order: Rami, Ahyeon, Chiquita, Asa, Rora, Pharita, and Ruka); and a pre-debut promotional single titled "Dream"â€”exclusively released via YouTube on May 14, 2023, debuting atop the Billboard Hot Trending Songs chart. Their channel soon surpassed one million subscribers in 52 days since its creation on December 28, 2022, and two million subscribers in 129 days, becoming the fastest K-pop girl group to reach the milestone.</p>
                <p>The group released two singles as a six-piece titled "Batter Up" and "Stuck in the Middle" on November 27, 2023, and February 1, 2024, respectively, with the former serving as the sextet's debut single and BabyMonster's pre-debut release. Label-mates Lee Chan-hyuk of AKMU and Choi Hyun-suk of Treasure contributed in penning the former piece, while its member Asa, worked on both its music and lyrics. Its music video amassed 22.59 million views within a day, became the most viewed debut music video in the first 24 hours in K-pop history, and became the fastest debut music video to reach 100 million views on the platform, eighteen days after its release. It found further success on Spotify, achieving 10 million streams in ten days, the fastest for a rookie K-pop girl group. Ahyeon, who was absent from its releases for health reasons, soon recovered and returned from her hiatus, joining the ensemble to promote their future activities as a seven-member group.</p>
                <p>BabyMonster for See You There in Jakarta, in June 2024.
                Marking the group's official debut, their first extended play (EP) BabyMons7er, was released on April 1. It was primarily supported by the titular single "Sheesh" and included re-recordings of "Batter Up" and "Stuck in the Middle" with all seven members, alongside a gift titled "Like That" by Charlie Puth following a viral cover of "Dangerously" sung by Ahyeon. The eponymous release recorded over 460,000 pre-orders, and debuted at number three on the Circle Album Chart. Initially released to lukewarm reception, "Sheesh" climbed the domestic charts following a surge in popularity through its live performances, peaking at number ten on the Circle Digital Chart. Furthermore, it became the highest entry for a K-pop girl group on Spotify that year, debuting with 1.76 million streams on its Daily Top Songs Global Chart at sixty-ninth place. In commemoration of their debut, a pop-up store was held at The Hyundai Seoul on the same date for ten days, welcoming 2,000 visitors in its first two days. In conjunction to their latest release, the septet embarked on their first fan meeting tour in May amidst six Asian regions: Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. In result, BabyMonster entered "arena-class" venues within forty days of their debut, selling out 26,000 tickets in their Tokyo stop alone.
                For BabyMonster's upcoming first studio album, a pre-release digital single titled "Forever" was released on July 1.</p>
